Everything I do

Look into my eyes
You will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart
Search your soul
And when you find me there
You'll search no more
Don't tell me it's not worth trying for
You can't tell me it's not worth dying for
You know is true
Everything I do
I do it for you

Look into your heart
You will find
There's nothing there to hide
Take me as i am
Take my life
I would give it all
I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fighting for
I can't help it, there's nothing i want more
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do it for you
There's no love
Like your love
And no other
Could give more love
There's nowhere
Unless you're there
All the time
All the way, yeah

Look into your heart, baby
Oh, you can't tell me it's not worth trying for
I can't help it there's nothing I want more
Yeah, I would fight for you
I lie for you
Walk the wire for you, yeah, I'd die for you
You know it's true
Everything I do
Oh

Everything I do, darling And we'll see it through
Oh, yeah

Look into your heart
You can't tell me it ain't worth dying for
Oh, yeah
