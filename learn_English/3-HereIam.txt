Here I am

Here i am, this is me
There's nowhere(不存在的地方) else(否则、另外的) on
Earth i'd rather(相当、宁愿、最好) be
Here i am, it's just me and you
Tonight we make our dreams come true
It's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive(活着的) with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you, here i am
Here we are, we've just begun
And after all this time, our time has come
Yeah, here we are, still goin' strong
Right here in the place where we belong
Oh, it's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you, here i am
Yeah, here i am, here i am
Yeah
Waitin' for you
It's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you, here i am
Here i am
Oh, right next to you
And suddenly the world is all brand new
Here i am, here i am
Where i'm gonna stay
Now there's nothing standin' in our way
Oh, here i am
Here i am
